/// # User implementation
///
/// There are two possible levels to implement. At least one level needs to be implemented:
/// * [`calculate_for_chromosome(...) -> Option<FitnessValue>`](Fitness::calculate_for_chromosome)
///   * The standard situation, suits all strategies. Implementable with all Genotypes.
///   * Standard [Genotype]s have [GenesOwner](crate::chromosome::GenesOwner) chromosomes. These
///     chromosomes have a `genes` field, which can be read for the calculations.
///   * non-standard [Genotype]s with [GenesPointer](crate::chromosome::GenesPointer) chromosomes.
///     These chromosomes have don't have a `genes` field, so you need to retrieve the genes using
///     [genotype.genes_slice(&chromosome)](crate::genotype::Genotype::genes_slice), which can then
///     be read for the calculations. But for these types you usually don't want to reach this call
///     level, see other level below
/// * [`calculate_for_population(...) -> Vec<Option<FitnessValue>>`](Fitness::calculate_for_population)
///   * *Only overwrite for matrix Genotypes (designed for possible GPU acceleration)*
///   * If not overwritten, results in calling
///     [calculate_for_chromosome](Fitness::calculate_for_chromosome) for each chromosome in the
///     population. So it doesn't have to be implemented by default, but it is a possible point to
///     intercept with a custom implementation where the whole population data is available.
///   * Only for [Genotype] with [GenesPointer](crate::chromosome::GenesPointer) chromosomes. These
///     chromosomes don't have a `genes` field to read, but a `row_id`. The matrix [Genotype] has a contiguous
///     memory `data` field with all the data, which can be calculated in one go.
///     * [DynamicMatrixGenotype](crate::genotype::DynamicMatrixGenotype)
///     * [StaticMatrixGenotype](crate::genotype::StaticMatrixGenotype)
///   * The order and length of the rows in the genotype data matrix needs to be preserved in the
///     returned vector as it matches the row_id on the chromosome
///   * The order and length of the population does not matter at all and will most likely not align.
///     The population is provided, because the full genotype matrix data also contains untainted
///     chromosomes which already have a fitness_score (and will not be updated). The results for
///     these chromosomes will be ignored, thus these do not have to be recalculated, so knowing
///     which ones might be relevant (or not). The order of the results still need to align, so if the
///     calculation is skipped, a `None` value should be inserted in the results to keep the order
///     and length aligned.
///
/// The strategies use different levels of calls in [Fitness]. So you cannot always just intercept at
/// [calculate_for_population](Fitness::calculate_for_population) and be sure
/// [calculate_for_chromosome](Fitness::calculate_for_chromosome) will not be called:
///
/// * Population level calculations (calling
///   [calculate_for_chromosome](Fitness::calculate_for_chromosome) indirectly through
///   [calculate_for_population](Fitness::calculate_for_population), if not overwritten)
///   * [Evolve](crate::strategy::evolve::Evolve)
///   * [HillClimb](crate::strategy::hill_climb::HillClimb) with [SteepestAscent](crate::strategy::hill_climb::HillClimbVariant::SteepestAscent)
/// * Chromosome level calculations (calling
///   [calculate_for_chromosome](Fitness::calculate_for_chromosome) directly, bypassing
///   [calculate_for_population](Fitness::calculate_for_population) entirely)
///   * [Permutate](crate::strategy::permutate::Permutate)
///   * [HillClimb](crate::strategy::hill_climb::HillClimb) with [Stochastic](crate::strategy::hill_climb::HillClimbVariant::Stochastic)
///
/// Therefore, additionally, you might need to implement
/// [calculate_for_chromosome](Fitness::calculate_for_chromosome) for
/// [GenesPointer](crate::chromosome::GenesPointer) chromosomes. This is sometimes needed when
/// testing out different strategies with different call levels. Problably no longer needed once
/// settled on a strategy.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// [calculate_for_chromosome](Fitness::calculate_for_chromosome) has a default implementation which panics, because it doesn't need to
/// be implemented for genotypes which implement [calculate_for_population](Fitness::calculate_for_population). Will panic if reached and not implemented.
