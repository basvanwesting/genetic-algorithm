//! The selection phase, where chromosomes are lined up for pairing in the
//! [crossover](crate::crossover) phase, dropping the chromosomes outside of the
//! target_population_size.
//!
//! The replacement_rate is the target fraction of the population which exists of
//! children. Generational Replacement and Steady-State Replacement can both be
//! modelled with this parameter by setting it respectively to 1.0 and 0.2-0.8.
//! High values converge faster, but risk losing good solutions. Low values
//! convergence slower. If there is a shortage of population after the ideal
//! fraction, firstly remaining non-selected children and secondly remaining
//! non-selected parents will be used to fill the shortage to avoid population
//! collapse.
//!
//! The elitism_rate is a non-generational elite gate, which ensures passing of the
//! best chromosomes before selection and replacement takes place. Value should
//! typically be very low, between 0.01 and 0.05. Relevant for
//! `SelectTournament` where the best chromosome is not guaranteed to be
//! selected for a tournament if the `population_size` is larger than the
//! `target_population_size`
