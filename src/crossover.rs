//! The crossover phase where every two parent chromosomes create two children chromosomes. The
//! [competition](crate::compete) phase determines the order of the parent pairing (overall with
//! fitter first). If you choose to keep the parents, the parents will compete with their own
//! children and the population is temporarily overbooked and half of it will be discarded in the
//! [competition](crate::compete) phase.
